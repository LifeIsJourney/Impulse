A barebones framework of Unity systems for getting any project off the ground very quickly. 
It is not a restrictive framework. Using a system does not force you into a programming paradigm or require you to structure the rest of your game a certain way - scripts are meant to be copied and pasted into your project and modified as you need.

## Model-View-Controller (MVC) Pattern ##

Keep in mind the framework is not intended to force you into any particular programming paradigm. 
However, the model-view-controller pattern used by the framework is an easy way to organize a project and is recommended as the 'default' way to structure a project.

## Useful Scripts ##

These can be used for a variety of purposes and are easily customizable and extensible.

 * ExtendedMonoBehavior.cs - Includes commonly used variable declarations for caching.
 * ChangeScene.cs - Calls the scene manager to switch scenes.
 * AutoSpinObj.cs - Causes an object to spin automatically upon start.
 * ArtificialFriction.cs - Applies artificial friction to an object moved by physics forces.

## Input Handling ##

These extend BaseInputController but the entire input system can be easily replaced with a different solution.

 * KeyboardInputController.cs - Translates keyboard inputs into general direction bools such as up, down, left, right, etc.
 * MouseInputController.cs - Grabs mouse position and click types.
 * ThirdPersonCameraMouseInputController.cs - Adds panning and zoom-in controls for use with the third person camera.
