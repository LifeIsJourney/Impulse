The Asset Location Editor 
=========================

Use this tool to move your downloaded Unity3D Assets to a different folder or hard drive on your computer and still access them through Unity in the normal way.
If like me, you find that your downloaded Assets are taking up valuable space on your C:\ drive you can use this tool to move your assets to another drive, Unity will not know any difference.

Instructions
============
1) Import the tool into a Unity project.
2) Go to Edit -> Edit Asset Location...
3) Create or select a folder where you would like your asset store items to be moved to.  This must be an empty folder.
4) Click OK.  The Console will print out some information and tell you when it is complete.  Please note that if you have a large amount of assets this process might take some time.

1) Import the tool into a Unity project.
2) Go to Edit -> Edit Assets Location...
3) Click the [Move] button next to the asset location you wish to move, there may be more than one location if you also used an earlier version of Unity3D.
4) Choose or create an EMPTY folder where you would like to move your assets to.
5) Check and confirm the details in the obligatory "Are you sure..." message box.
6) Wait until all of your assets have been moved.  A progress bar gives you an idea of how long this will take, if you have a large asset collection this could take a long time...
7) Once complete, you will see the "Current Location:" of your assets change to your newly selected location.
8) You can now delete the asset from your project, it is not needed any more unless you want to move your assets to a new location again.
